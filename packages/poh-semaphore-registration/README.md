# Proof of Humanity Semaphore Registration

A basic frontend which allows you to:

- Check if your Ethereum address is registered on the Proof of Humanity Protocol
- If yes to the above, register an identity commitment to PoH Semaphore
- Claim the deposits of users whose identity commitments are no longer valid (and remove them)
